## Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files via url.
*please note when validating via url , both art details and sign up throw an error:*
art_detail error ![screenshot](documentation/w3c_art_detail_url_error.png)
signup_url error ![screenshot](documentation/w3c_signup_url_error.png)


- *Once validating via direct input, all is good* :

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

| File | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| base.css | ![screenshot](documentation/base_css.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| checkout.css | ![screenshot](documentation/checkout_css.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| profile.css | ![screenshot](documentation/profile_css.png) | Pass: No Errors |

### JS
I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files. Needed for testing at the top of the file: (/* jshint esversion: 11, jquery: true */)


| File | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| stripe_elements.js | ![screenshot](documentation/js_stripe_elements.png) | No Errors |
| countryfield.js | ![screenshot](documentation/js_countryfield.png) | Pass: No Errors |


### Python Validation

[CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) was used to validate the Python files that were created or edited by myself. No errors were found. Due to extensive amount of screenshots I had chosen to include the table instead that I had validates one by one, but to backup my findings I also ran code via Flake8 (code made by me have no erros that I am in control of);

### Lighthouse Scores

Lighthouse testing was carried out in Incognito mode to achieve the best result. Images used in the site's design were saved in png format, and compressed using [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) to offer the best chance for a decent performance score. I am not happy with the results of the testing as they seem to be very low. My aim is to have a very high quality , large images so I will need to work around it to ensure that wont affect loading time and overall health of the website.  I will carry additional improvements in the fututre to acheive minimum of 85% for the best experience.

### Unresolved/Known Bugs

Some adjsutemnt needed in About section,  Image is too small on desktop; 
Shopping cart footer needs to be pushed down. I had spend quite a lot of time fixing it only to findout it affected  other impotant aspects. 
Similary had a huge issue with images on my detail page. Sicne i decided to use multiple images and have the ones not displaying being placed underneath of main image I did ot manage to do it without a warning coming up due to double id. The fact is that in the detail page, the main image will always have a copy underneath. This  
Since a lot of time was involved to getting it right I had decided to let it go back to it with a fresh, rested mind once all is done.
